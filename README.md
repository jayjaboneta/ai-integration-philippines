**KenzoAI PH: AI Integration Interactive Proposal**

A single-page, interactive web application designed to serve as a strategic roadmap and dynamic business proposal for offering AI integration services in the Philippines.

This tool is specifically tailored to address the unique pain points of two core Philippine sectors: Education (Schools & Colleges) and MSMEs (Retail & Services).

**🎯 Project Objective**

The goal of this application is to visually and interactively pitch AI services to local enterprises. Instead of a static PDF report, this interactive dashboard allows potential clients to see concrete use cases, project their Return on Investment (ROI), and review clear implementation phases.

**✨ Key Features**

Interactive Sector Toggling: Seamlessly switch between "Education" and "SME" contexts, dynamically updating all content, pain points, and solutions on the page.

Problem/Solution Matrix: Contextualized cards detailing specific local problems (e.g., DepEd MELC alignment, BIR compliance) paired with actionable AI solutions.

Dynamic Impact Visualizer: Interactive sliders and Chart.js visualizations that allow users to project efficiency gains and revenue growth based on AI adoption levels.

Clear Service Packages: A tiered "Go-to-Market" roadmap (Audit, Integration, Scale) to help package and sell AI services.

Zero Backend Required: Fully self-contained SPA (Single Page Application) using Vanilla JS, making it infinitely scalable and free to host.

**🛠️ Tech Stack **

HTML5: Semantic structure.

Tailwind CSS (via CDN): For rapid, responsive, and modern UI styling.

Vanilla JavaScript: For state management, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.

Chart.js (via CDN): For dynamic, responsive data visualization.
